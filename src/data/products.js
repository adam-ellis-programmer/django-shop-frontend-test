Crafted from high-quality porcelain clay and fired at 2,400Â°F, these pieces offer exceptional durability while maintaining a refined, lightweight feel. The minimalist design features a matte finish exterior contrasted with a glossy glazed interior, creating a sophisticated two-tone effect that complements both casual and formal table settings. Available in classic white, soothing sage green, or contemporary navy blue, this set can be the foundation of your table dÃ©cor or mixed with existing pieces for an eclectic look. The plates feature a subtle raised rim that prevents spills while maintaining a modern profile. Each piece is dishwasher-safe for effortless cleaning and microwave-safe for convenient reheating, while also being oven-safe up to 450Â°F for warming and serving. The chip-resistant construction stands up to daily use, and the non-porous glaze prevents staining and odor absorption, ensuring your set maintains its beauty for years to come.',
